It is recommended the files read first are the Question Sheet.pdf, followed by a read through of the answer.pdf and the files in discussion for each section of this report.

EXPLANATION OF FILES:

Question Sheet.pdf - This outlines the task at hand and should be read first, and gives explanations to some of the other files.

probeA.csv - This is the known data (to train on) as discussed in the question sheet.

probeB.csv - This is the unknown data (to test on) as discussed in the question sheet.

predictClass.py - This answers Q1 of the question sheet.

Classification+Cross+Validation.py - This is the supporting file to predictClass and shows how the optimal hyper-parameters were chosen for predictClass.

predictTNA.py - This answers Q2 of the question sheet.

Classification+Cross+Validation.py - This is the supporting file to predictTNA and shows how the optimal hyper-parameters were chosen for predictTNA.

answer.pdf - This answers Q3 of the question sheet.
